## Qubits = duality! 

On is dual to off, spin up is dual to spin down.
Photons are dual. Light is either predictable (syntropy) as in reflection from a mirror or unpredictable as in diffuse surfaces. Randomness (diffuse, uncertainty) is dual to order (mirrors, certainty) -- the Heisenberg certainty/uncertainty principle.
Duality = two sides of the same coin (heads or tails).
Entangled entropy = correlated information or mutual information = syntropy!
Bosons are dual to Fermions -- spin statistics theorem.
Predictability (syntropy) is dual to unpredictability (entropy) -- the 4th law of thermodynamics!
Teleological physics (syntropy) is dual to non-teleological physics (entropy).
Duality creates reality!
Mind (the internal soul, syntropy) is dual to matter (the external soul, entropy) -- Descartes.

### "Always two there are" -- Yoda.


Certainty is dual to uncertainty -- the Heisenberg certainty/uncertainty principle.
Gravitation is equivalent or dual to acceleration -- Einstein's happiest thought, the principle of equivalence (duality).
Energy is dual to mass -- Einstein.
Dark energy is dual to dark matter.
Space is dual to time -- Einstein.
Time dilation is dual to length contraction -- Einstein, special relativity.
Binary (0 and 1, on and off), polarization, dichotomy, complements, conjugates = dualities!
Bosons (waves) are entities that like to be in the same state -- a laser beam.
Fermions (particles) are entities that like to be in different states.
Same is dual to different.
Bosons are dual to Fermions, wave/particle or quantum duality -- spin statistics theorem.
Energy is duality, duality is energy!
You can study quantum computing when you understand duality & the 4th law of thermodynamics!
There is a dual process to that of increasing entropy:-
Syntropy (predictability) is dual to increasing entropy (unpredictability).
Teleological physics (syntropy) is dual to non-teleological physics (entropy).
New insights lead to a deeper understanding of the physics.
Absolute truth is dual to relative truth -- Hume's fork.
