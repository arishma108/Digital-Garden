## Qubits = duality! 

On is dual to off, spin up is dual to spin down.
Photons are dual. Light is either predictable (syntropy) as in reflection from a mirror or unpredictable as in diffuse surfaces. Randomness (diffuse, uncertainty) is dual to order (mirrors, certainty) -- the Heisenberg certainty/uncertainty principle.
Duality = two sides of the same coin (heads or tails).
Entangled entropy = correlated information or mutual information = syntropy!
Bosons are dual to Fermions -- spin statistics theorem.
Predictability (syntropy) is dual to unpredictability (entropy) -- the 4th law of thermodynamics!
Teleological physics (syntropy) is dual to non-teleological physics (entropy).
Duality creates reality!
Mind (the internal soul, syntropy) is dual to matter (the external soul, entropy) -- Descartes.
